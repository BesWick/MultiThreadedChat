Final HW: Chat Program
    

What is this? 
    A TCP-based chat program composed of a client for the end users and a server program which will be used to connect clients so that they can exchange messages. The client operates in three modes: asking the server for information (INFO), waiting to be contacted by another client (WAIT), or exchanging messages with another client (CHAT). For more information check out my final report (finalreport.pdf)!
